# C++ Coroutine #
This is collection of C++ coroutine samples from vaious sources. Most of them are from Gor Nishanov's presentation. Sometimes I slightly modified and added more comments.
* [Examples](https://github.com/chaelim/Coroutine/tree/master/Examples) conatins simple examples of C++ coroutine (one cpp file per example)
* [SuperLean](https://github.com/chaelim/Coroutine/tree/master/SuperLean) forked from [SuperLean](https://github.com/GorNishanov/await/tree/master/2015_CppCon/SuperLean)

Although I couldn't explicitly stated credits to original creator, the credits should go to where it belong.
